Student Answer: 

public virtual void addToEnd(int newValue)
	{
		List runner = this;
		while (next != null)
		{
			runner = runner.next;
		}
		next = new List(newValue);
	}


Fix: (1) while runner.next != null;
	 (2) runner.next = new List(newValue);

Redundant: none

SOLUTION: 

 public virtual void addToEnd(int newValue)
	{
               
        List runner = this;
        while (runner.next != null)
        {
            runner = runner.next;
        }
        runner.next = new List(newValue);
